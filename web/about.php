        My name is John Wood. I have really enjoyed working in four different 
        internships in software engineering and data science. During the Winter
        in Rexburg, my wife and I play board games like Scythe, Pandemic Legacy,
        and Photosynthesis. I also really enjoy jazz. Check out 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxbWlDyjP9s">this new song</a> released 
        by my favorite band, Snarky Puppy. There is a triple polyrhythm at the end 
        and it's incredible.
